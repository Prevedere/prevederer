## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Updated the title and description to remove the redundant "R".
* Added single quotes to 'Prevedere' in the title and description.
* Added a URL for 'Prevedere' in the description.
* Added additional information about 'Prevedere' and the package functionality 
to the description.
* All functions require an API key, so all examples remain inside \dontrun{}.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.0
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.0
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

From win-builder:

* Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Prevedere (3:26, 6:47)
  
  Prevedere is the name of the company for which the API is written
